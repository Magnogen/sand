# sand
##### https://magnogen.net/sand
## A browser-based Cellular Automata

This is the source code for a small project written in JavaScript.
So far, only Sand is paintable - you cant even paint with air lol.

### How it works
Simply click anywhere on the canvas to paint some sand.
Sand falls downwards, and if there's a space to the bottom left or right corners, it'll fall there too.
I've added the backend for Air and Water already, it's just a matter of adding the interface to allow you to paint it.

### Plans for the future
I'd like to add a few features for things like
- [x] MORE ELEMENTS
  
  (And a way to switch between them)
- [ ] Making it work on touchscreen devices (mobiles)
- [ ] Resetting the canvas,

  (Maybe a keybind? Or a button in a menu?)
- [ ] A menu for different types of paint to use,

  (Air, Sand, Water, and maybe a few other new ones like Acid, Gas, Coal, Fire, etc.
  Maybe a few fictional substances?)
- [ ] Support for custom-made elements with unique properties

  (So you too can make new elements that react and respond with their surroundings!
  Maybe a custom programming language?)
- [ ] Different colouring methods

  (I had a play with this while I was making it, I added a colouring system that looked kinda like Noita, and a couple of others, but settled with what I have now.
  Maybe a way to toggle between them somehow?)
