###### Easy-peasy Cellular Automata https://magnogen.net/sand

This is the source code for a small project written in JavaScript.

### How it works
Simply click anywhere on the canvas to paint into the world.
There are a variety of elements that you can paint with, including Sand, Air, Water and Lava.
See how everything interacts!

### Plans for the future
I'd like to add a few features for things like
- [x] MORE ELEMENTS
- [x] Making it work on touchscreen devices (mobiles)
  - [ ] Make this work better and less blue. You know what I mean lol
- [x] Resetting the canvas

  Drawing over everything with air is good enough, but maybe a button too?
  - [ ] `Reset World` button
- [x] A menu for different types of paint to use
  - [ ] Make this better looking
- [x] Support for custom-made elements with unique properties

  So you'll have to write it in JavaScript at the moment, but I plan on making it its own language soon.
  - [ ] Language
- [x] Different colouring methods

  (I had a play with this while I was making it, I added a colouring system that looked kinda like Noita, and a couple of others, but settled with what I have now.
  Maybe a way to toggle between them somehow?)
